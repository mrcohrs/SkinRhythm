You must return a complete, production-ready React component using the same imports and design system (Button, Badge, Card, lucide-react icons, etc.). Keep the same routing (/quiz). Keep the same section order:

Header

Hero

How It Works

Personalization Flow

Why AcneAgent Works (Problem / Science / Personalization Proof)

NEW: Premium vs Free section

Footer

Your job is to clean and elevate the visual system, tighten copy, and weave Premium into the story. The changes below are mandatory.

GLOBAL VISUAL RULES

Apply consistent vertical rhythm: each major <section> should use py-20 md:py-24 (hero can stay bigger).

Use consistent containers (max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 md:px-8 lg:px-16 or equivalent).

All “cards” in multi-card layouts must share the same visual style: rounded-2xl, subtle border, bg-background or bg-muted/30, tasteful shadow-sm. Kill any gimmicky neon gradients, novelty blobs, or weird animated connector lines. It currently looks chaotic and junior. We want calm and clinical.

Icons at the top of cards should sit in a soft circular chip (rounded-full, light tint of primary or secondary) for visual consistency.

CTA buttons:

Primary CTA buttons should be rounded-full, px-8 py-6 h-auto text-base font-medium.

Under every major CTA button, include a reassurance line in text-xs text-muted-foreground like “No login. Takes under 2 minutes.”

GLOBAL COPY RULES

Keep the current brand tone: direct, empathetic, no shame.

Keep “simple, affordable, effective” tone in hero — do NOT rewrite the hero headline to some generic SaaS thing.

We CANNOT promise guaranteed acne clearance. Always say “reduce breakouts,” “prevent new clogs,” “calm inflammation,” “support clearer skin,” etc.

We MUST communicate that AcneAgent is:
(1) a personalized acne routine generator,
(2) an acne-safe skincare marketplace, and
(3) an upgrade path (Premium) with Ingredient Checker, alternatives, tracking.

Premium should be positioned as “more control / more support,” not “paywall to get value.”

COLOR TOKENS

Use existing tokens. Refer to brand teal as primary, accent orange as secondary, light grey backgrounds as muted background. Do NOT hardcode new hex values. You may still use bg-primary/10, etc., like the current code does.

SECTION-BY-SECTION REQUIREMENTS

HEADER

Keep sticky header.

Keep logo + “Log In” + “Take the Quiz”.

Keep visual style consistent with the rest of the page (border bottom, blur, etc.).

No new messaging here. Clean, quiet.

HERO
Goal: reassure, position AcneAgent as “routine + marketplace,” and softly introduce Premium.

Structure:

Left column: headline, subhead, feature bullets, CTA.

Right column: “Your Starter Routine” preview card showing 3 steps and price ranges.

Copy changes:

Keep the headline almost exactly as it is, but convert to sentence case for polish:
“A simple, affordable, effective clear skin plan — made just for you.”

Keep the supporting line “Based on science, not trial and error.” Then directly below it, add:
“Get a personalized acne routine and shop only acne-safe products that are screened for pore-clogging ingredients.”

Keep the 3 feature callouts you already have (AI-Powered Guidance / Clinically-Proven Routines / The Only Acne-Safe Marketplace), but tighten them:
• AI-Powered Guidance
“Your virtual skincare coach adapts your plan over time.”
• Clinically-Informed Routines
“We use dermatologist-style treatment logic, not TikTok trends.”
• The Only Acne-Safe Marketplace
“Every product is screened for 400+ pore-clogging ingredients before we recommend it.”
(update “Clinically-Proven Routines” to “Clinically-Informed Routines” and remove the “shown to clear acne in over 90% of cases” claim — that’s a medical claim, drop it)

Add one short Premium teaser sentence under the bullet stack:
“Upgrade to Premium for ingredient scanning and multiple product options for each step of your routine.”
Style this as text-xs text-muted-foreground.

CTA block (under hero text):

Main button: “Generate My Free Routine”

Subtext under button:
“No login. Takes under 2 minutes.”

Compliance line beneath that (keep this line, you already have it):
“Educational skincare guidance only; not a medical diagnosis.”

Right-side routine preview card:

Show a rounded card with soft border and bg-muted/30.

Header text in that card: “Your Starter Routine (example)”

3 rows inside:

Cleanser — “Gentle, non-stripping” — “~$10”

Moisturizer — “Barrier support” — “~$14”

SPF — “Daily, no pore-clogging fillers” — “~$13”

Beneath those rows, add a muted footnote line:
“All products in your plan are acne-safe.”

Under that, tiny line in text-xs text-muted-foreground:
“Premium unlocks alternative product options if you’re sensitive or on a strict budget.”

That right card matters for conversion: it proves affordability visually and quietly introduces Premium value (alternatives).

Layout:

On desktop, hero should be a two-column grid with balanced spacing.

On mobile, stack: text → CTA → preview card.

HOW IT WORKS
Right now this section is chaotic across cards. You must normalize it.

Visual rules:

3 cards in a responsive grid.

Each card:

top: round badge “Step 1 / Step 2 / Step 3”

below: icon chip (circle with icon in primary or secondary tint)

headline

body

tiny supporting note

All 3 cards MUST share the same structure and spacing.

Copy (replace the current card titles/bodies with this exact structure):

Step 1
Headline: “Tell us about your skin”
Body: “Answer a few quick questions about oiliness, sensitivity, breakout pattern, and skin tone. No photos needed.”
Tiny note: “We learn what actually causes your acne — not just ‘dry / oily / combo.’”

Step 2
Headline: “Get your personalized acne routine”
Body: “You immediately get a morning + night plan built for your acne type, using only acne-safe products from our marketplace.”
Tiny note: “No login required to view your first routine.”

Step 3
Headline: “Shop it and stay on track”
Body: “You’ll see exactly what to use, when to use it, and where to get it — plus budget options. Create a free account to start tracking progress.”
Tiny note (explicit Premium hook here):
“Premium unlocks alternative product options for each step, weekly routine adjustments, and the Ingredient Checker.”

Under the 3 cards:

Keep the trust strip (shield + ‘screened for pore-clogging ingredients’, clock + ‘takes under 2 minutes’). Style it as an intentional muted info bar, not an afterthought.

Then CTA:
Button: “Generate My Free Routine”
Subtext line under CTA:
“This is educational skincare guidance, not a medical diagnosis.”

PERSONALIZATION FLOW (“How AcneAgent Personalizes Your Routine”)
You currently have 5 “nodes” (Skin Quiz, Analysis, Ingredient Scan, Routine Builder, Clear Skin Plan). Keep those 5, but drop the animated connector line and weird gradient pulse. Make it a clean 5-item responsive grid. Everything visually aligned: circular bordered icon → title → 1-line body.

Update the body text of two nodes to get Premium into this section:

Ingredient Scan
“We screen products for pore-clogging ingredients before they ever reach your routine.”
Add a tiny subline under it in text-[10px] text-muted-foreground:
“Premium lets you scan ANY product you already own.”

Clear Skin Plan
“You get a routine you can actually follow and afford.”
Add tiny subline:
“Premium keeps it updated as your skin changes.”

Section intro text should mention speed + differentiation for SEO:
Headline stays: “How AcneAgent Personalizes Your Routine”
Body under headline should be:
“Here’s how we generate your personalized acne routine in under 2 minutes — and why it’s not just another generic ‘skin type’ quiz.”

CTA at bottom:
Button text: “Take the Free Quiz”
Subtext: “No login required.”

WHY ACNEAGENT WORKS — BLOCK A (“THE PROBLEM” dark card)
Visually keep the dark 2-column card with “THE PROBLEM.” That’s working.
Copy fixes:

Replace any numeric cure claims with safer, still scary truth:
“Most products marketed as ‘non-comedogenic’ still contain known pore-clogging fillers. Brands can legally call a product ‘acne-safe’ even if it keeps you breaking out.”

Keep the Rejected vs Approved cards, but make sure approved includes:

“0 flagged pore-clogging ingredients”

“Barrier-safe for daily use”

Add a tiny legal-ish reassurance line at the bottom (text-xs muted):
“Ingredient screening and product vetting are for educational purposes and do not replace medical care.”

NO Premium mention here. This block is credibility / pain.

WHY ACNEAGENT WORKS — BLOCK B (“THE SCIENCE” ingredient tiles)
Keep this grid. It looks like a periodic table and that feels science-backed.

Above the tiles, add a single short paragraph in muted text that helps SEO and Premium story:
“We prioritize proven acne-fighting ingredients — benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, mandelic acid, retinal — and match them to what your skin can actually tolerate. Premium gives you alternative options if you’re sensitive or on a darker Fitzpatrick tone.”

Inside each tile:

Keep the Best for: line.

Keep the claims barrier-safe (“calms active breakouts,” “helps prevent new clogs,” “supports barrier,” etc.).

WHY ACNEAGENT WORKS — BLOCK C (“PERSONALIZED, NOT GENERIC”)
Keep the current 2-column layout: left = messaging + bullets, right = persona cards.
Update copy to explicitly link Premium to ongoing support:

Main headline: “No two routines are the same.”

Body paragraph should become:
“AcneAgent builds your plan from dermatologist-informed acne treatment structures. Each step can be filled with vetted, acne-safe product options from our marketplace — including drugstore, mid-range, and splurge. As your skin changes, we adjust. Premium gives you alternative product options for each step, routine tweaks over time, and Ingredient Checker access.”

Bullets (keep them, they’re strong):

Always acne-safe

Budget-first recommendations

Smart swaps if you’re sensitive

Persona cards:

Keep them. They’re doing social proof and inclusivity work (different ages, Fitz types, sensitivities).

Make sure tone is descriptive, not promising outcomes.

CTA under this block:
Button: “Get My Free Routine”
Subtext: “Takes under 2 minutes. No credit card.”

NEW SECTION: PREMIUM VS FREE
After Block C and BEFORE the footer, insert a new full-width section with muted background that clearly lays out free vs Premium. This is mandatory.

Visual:

Section background: bg-muted/30.

Centered heading + 2-column comparison cards.

Two cards side by side (on mobile they stack):

Card 1: “Free”

Bullet list:
• Personalized acne routine
• Acne-safe product picks you can buy right now
• Budget-friendly starter routine (~$60 core: cleanser + moisturizer + SPF)

Footer label in small muted text:
“Great if you’re just getting started.”

Card 2: “Premium”

Add a small chip at the top of this card: Badge with secondary: “More control”

Bullet list:
• Multiple vetted product options for each step (drugstore → splurge)
• Ingredient Checker: paste any product to see if it contains pore-clogging ingredients
• Progress tracking and routine tweaks as your skin changes

Footer label in small muted text:
“Founding rate: $2.99/mo”

Under these two cards:

CTA button centered:
“Unlock Premium”

Tiny reassurance line under button:
“Keep using the free plan if it’s working. No pressure.”

We want this section to feel friendly, honest, non-predatory. The message is: you get real value for free, Premium just gives you more control + support.

FOOTER
Keep footer layout, links, legal copy.
Add 1 positioning line above the legal paragraph in muted text:
“AcneAgent is the only acne-safe skincare marketplace that gives you a personalized routine, ingredient screening, and budget-friendly alternatives.”

Keep the disclaimer block you already have (“This is not a substitute for medical care…”). That’s important for compliance and also builds trust.

SEO NOTES
Throughout the updated component, keep these phrases in flowing body text (not keyword stuffing, just natural):

“personalized acne routine”

“acne-safe skincare products”

“pore-clogging ingredients”

“ingredient checker”

“non-comedogenic”

“acne-safe marketplace”

“budget-friendly acne routine”

“Fitzpatrick skin tone”

“barrier support”
This helps us rank for exactly what we are.

FINAL DEV REQUIREMENTS

Return one updated Landing.tsx React component with all changes applied.

Keep imports the same unless you remove unused.

Keep Button, Badge, Card, etc.

Keep routing to /quiz.

Make sure <h1> only appears in the hero. All other section headings should be <h2> for semantic SEO.

Every CTA under every major block must include a trust-reducing subtext line (“No login,” “No credit card,” etc.). That’s conversion-critical.

Do NOT add modals, carousels, or newsletter signup.

Do NOT gate the free routine behind email.
