Global Rules

Show only the most relevant 1–2 cards at a time per page to avoid clutter.

Cards have a clear title, short body, and primary CTA; optional secondary CTA when specified.

If a card is acted on (CTA clicked) or dismissed, deprioritize it for 7 days.

Banners rotate weekly (A → B → C) for Premium users only.

Page: Quiz Results (right after quiz completion)
Card 1 — How it Works

Copy

Title: Your personalized AcneAgent routine.

Body: Every product we recommend has been rigorously analyzed to ensure it’s an acne-safe, high-quality formulation that complements the other products in your custom regimen.

CTA: [View My Routine]

Placement & Audience

Position directly under the Routine headline.

Show to all users on first visit to Results.

Acceptance Criteria

Appears immediately after results load.

CTA navigates to Dashboard → My Products tab.

After first view or CTA click, card does not reappear on Results for 7 days.

Card 2 — Budgeting

Copy

Title: AcneAgent Works with Your Budget

Body: By default, AcneAgent recommends the least expensive products that meet your unique skin’s requirements. If you can’t get your entire routine, begin with your cleanser, moisturizer, and SPF (max subtotal about $60). These help keep your skin balanced and healthy until you are able to introduce the actives.

CTAs: [View Full Routine] (primary), [View Core Routine] (secondary)

Placement & Audience

Directly below Card 1 on Results.

Acceptance Criteria

Primary CTA opens Dashboard → My Products.

Secondary CTA opens a lightweight “Core Routine” view (Cleanser, Moisturizer, SPF).

If user later marks all products as “purchased” (or equivalent action), deprioritize this card for 30 days.

Page: Dashboard → My Products (default tab)
Card 4 — Ingredient Scanner Access (Free Trial)

Copy

Title: Check if non-routine products are acne-safe.

Body: When you create a free account, you receive 1-week access to an AcneAgent Premium Feature for free: the Ingredient Scanner. Copy & paste any product ingredient list and the tool quickly flags any acne-causing ingredients. Remember, a product is only acne-safe if every single ingredient in it is.

CTA: [Open Ingredient Scanner →]

Placement & Audience

Mid-page within the product list context.

Show to free users who are within the 7-day scanner access window and have ≤3 total scans used.

Acceptance Criteria

CTA deep-links to the Scanner tab.

Card hides if user becomes Premium or 7-day window ends.

If user has not used the scanner by day 5, surface a subtle reminder chip on the card: “2 days left.”

Card 5 — Makeup Reminder

Copy

Title: Makeup isn’t the enemy

Body: Just run your product list through the Ingredient Checker, or explore our curated acne-friendly beauty picks.

CTA: [Explore acne-safe beauty →]

Placement & Audience

Below the Ingredient Scanner card on My Products.

Show to all users who have completed the quiz at least once.

Acceptance Criteria

CTA navigates to the acne-safe beauty collection (with affiliate disclosure visible).

If user visits that collection at least once, deprioritize for 14 days.

Card 3 — Contact Us

Copy

Title: We’re here to help

Body: We love to help users find what works for them, whether it’s deciding on alternative product options or making adjustments for different budgets. Our mission is to make clear skin accessible to everyone.

CTA: [Contact us →]

Placement & Audience

Last element on My Products before the footer.

Acceptance Criteria

CTA opens Contact form/modal.

For Premium users, render in a compact variant (same copy, smaller visual weight).

Page: Dashboard → Ingredient Scanner (tab)

Empty State (reuse Card 4 content)

If user has 0 lifetime scans, show Card 4 copy centered as the empty state with [Open Ingredient Scanner →] replaced by [Paste Ingredients].

If free user exceeds 3 scans, do not show Card 4; instead open the Scanner Paywall (separate flow) with Premium/Unlimited/Packs options.

Acceptance Criteria

Empty state transitions to scan input on CTA.

After first successful scan, empty state is replaced by recent scan history.

Page: Dashboard (Premium users) — Weekly Banner Rotation

Placement

Single slim banner above the tab bar; one banner at a time; rotates weekly.

Banners

A: “Consistency builds confidence — stay with your AcneAgent routine and check all new products for acne-safe ingredients.”

B: “Barrier first. New breakouts later. Stick with the products in your plan.”

C: “Not sure if a product fits your routine? Use the Ingredient Checker before you add it in.”

Acceptance Criteria

Show only to active Premium users.

One banner visible; switches automatically every 7 days.

If user dismisses a banner, suppress it for 14 days and advance to the next.

Cross-Page Logic & Suppression

If user upgrades to Premium, immediately hide:

Card 4 (Scanner Access Trial) everywhere.

If user’s 7-day trial ends and they’re still free:

Replace Card 4 on My Products with a small inline nudge: “Need to check a product? Get Unlimited scans with Premium.”

Never show more than two cards stacked; if multiple cards qualify, prioritize:

Card 4 (trial urgency)

Card 2 (Budgeting)

Card 1 (How it Works)

Card 5 (Makeup Reminder)

Card 3 (Contact Us)

Success Criteria (MVP)

Results page shows Card 1 and Card 2 in sequence for first-time users.

My Products shows at least one contextual card (based on the rules above).

Ingredient Scanner empty state uses Card 4 content; paywall appears after 3 scans.

Premium users see exactly one rotating weekly banner; free users do not.

Cards/banners suppress/hide appropriately after action, dismissal, upgrade, or trial expiry.
