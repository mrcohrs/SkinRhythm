🌿 Secondary & Support Colors
Role	Name	HEX	Description
Secondary Cool	Hydro Mist	#CDE9E7	Pale bluish green for cards, hovers, or illustrations. Suggests cleanliness and moisture.
Secondary Warm	Soft Apricot	#FFD8BF	Used sparingly to signal human touch (buttons, highlights). Keeps the site from feeling sterile.
Validation / Success	Verdant Calm	#8EC7A4	Muted sage tone to indicate “acne-safe,” “approved,” or “verified.” Feels organic yet professional.

⚖️ Balance Ratios

60 % Paper White (backgrounds)

20 % Clearwater Blue (primary brand surfaces, CTAs)

10 % Graphite Ink (typography)

7 % Hydro Mist (secondary backgrounds, cards)

3 % Restorative Peach or Soft Apricot (accent warmth)

🧠 Psychological Rationale

Blue-green → trust, cleanliness, and transparency (common in clinical and wellness brands).

Peach / apricot undertones → empathy, human skin connection.

Sage / mint secondary → renewal and balance, less artificial than pure blue.

Graphite Ink → authority without heaviness.

This palette positions AcneAgent between medical technology (precision) and emotional wellness (relief), giving it both credibility and approachability.
