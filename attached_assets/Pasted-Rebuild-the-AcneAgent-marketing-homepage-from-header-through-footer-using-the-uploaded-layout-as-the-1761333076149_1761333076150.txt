Rebuild the AcneAgent marketing homepage from header through footer using the uploaded layout as the visual base, but upgraded for conversion, trust, credibility, and user motivation. Use the section order and copy below. You must apply the following global rules throughout the page:

GLOBAL STYLE / SYSTEM

Visual tone: clinical, trustworthy, modern, human. No influencer fluff.

Typography:

Headlines use the brand serif for authority.

Body, bullets, and UI text use the brand sans for clarity.

Color usage:

“primary” = science / trust accent (currently teal in brand).

“secondary” = attention / alert / highlight (currently orange in brand).

“muted background” = light neutral background used for soft contrast sections.

“body text” = main dark text color.

“subtle text” = lighter, low-emphasis text color.

“inverted text” = light-on-dark text for contrast cards.

“hairline border” = low-contrast divider lines.

Components:

All feature cards and callouts use rounded corners (16–24px radius) with “soft clinical shadow.”

All pills / badges / tags are fully rounded with bold small text.

All CTAs are pill buttons with filled “primary” background and white text, plus hover/active/focus-visible states.

Iconography:

Use consistent outline icons with rounded geometry and a single stroke weight. No photoreal product shots.

All icons should feel like they’re from one system.

Background visuals:

Use molecule / node / connection motifs in very low-opacity line art.

These appear behind hero content, behind titles, and in large section backgrounds to reinforce “science + systems.”

They must not compete with text legibility.

CTA strategy:

After every major section, include a CTA.

CTA text should point to action, like “Generate My Free Routine →” or “Take the Free Quiz →”.

Voice:

First sentence of each bullet is bold and is the benefit. Second sentence supports it.

Remove friction language. Promise outcome, speed, control, relief.

PAGE ORDER (TOP → BOTTOM)
You must build the following sections in this exact order: Header → Hero → How It Works → Personalization Flow → Why AcneAgent Works → Footer.

SECTION 1. HEADER
Goal: Establish brand legitimacy without overwhelming the user.

Layout:

White / light header bar with subtle “hairline border” on the bottom.

Left: AcneAgent wordmark next to a simple molecule icon (thin outline with a small “primary” accent node). Include alt text and aria-label.

Right: two inline links:

Plain text link: “Log In”

Text link styled like a quiet CTA: “Take the Quiz”

Spacing should feel like a clean DTC brand header — medium vertical padding, plenty of whitespace. Nothing bulky or app-like. No “dashboard” feel.

Behavior:

This header can be sticky on scroll if it doesn’t feel heavy.

SECTION 2. HERO (ABOVE THE FOLD)
Goal: Hit pain, promise, credibility, and safety above the fold. The user should know “this finally fixes it” within 3 seconds.

Layout:

Two-column on desktop:

Left column: text and CTA.

Right column: subtle, soft network / molecule visualization that implies “intelligent skin mapping.” This should look like connected nodes using the brand geometry. Gentle glow pulses in “primary,” but extremely calm.

Stack vertically on mobile, with text first.

Left column content:

Main headline (large serif, multi-line, high contrast “body text” color):
“A Simple, Affordable, and Effective Clear Skin Plan. Made Just for You.”

Supporting line (sans, “subtle text” color):
“Based on science, not trial and error.”

Intro lead-in with a small inline AcneAgent icon:
“AcneAgent takes the guesswork out of acne with:”

Value bullets (each bullet row has: small outline icon + bold lead + supporting line):

AI-Powered Guidance
Your virtual skincare coach learns your skin and adapts your plan over time.

Icon: outline brain / circuit / sparkle shield, in “primary.”

Clinically-Proven Routines
Built from treatment methods shown to clear acne in over 90% of cases.

Icon: outline lab flask or microscope, accented with “secondary.”

The Only Acne-Safe Marketplace
Every product we recommend is screened for 400+ pore-clogging ingredients, so you never unknowingly sabotage your skin.

Icon: outline shield-check with “primary” accent.

Primary CTA button directly under bullets:

Pill button using “primary” background, white text.

Text: “Generate Free Custom Routine →”

Under the CTA, include a single-line legal disclaimer in very small “subtle text”:
“Educational skincare guidance only; not a medical diagnosis.”

SEO note:

Within this hero text, naturally include “personalized acne routine,” “acne-safe products,” “non-comedogenic,” and “evidence-based acne treatment.”

SECTION 3. HOW IT WORKS
Goal: Reduce perceived friction. Make it feel fast, immediate, and in the user’s control. The sequence should say “you get value instantly,” not “you have to sign up first.”

Visual structure:

Section headline centered: “How it works”

Below headline: a 3-card row on desktop / stacked cards on mobile.

Every card:

White background.

Rounded corners (large radius).

“Soft clinical shadow.”

Internal padding with breathable spacing.

Top-left chip: rounded pill with “secondary” background and white text that says “Step 1”, “Step 2”, “Step 3”.

Below chip, a simple illustration that matches the step (outlined style, minimal fill, “primary” accents).

Then headline and short copy.

Use this exact card content:

Card 1:

Step chip: “Step 1”

Headline: “Tell us about your skin.”

Body:
“Answer a few quick questions. We build your skin profile in under 2 minutes — no confusing dermatology jargon.”

Micro-CTA link at bottom in “primary”: “Start My Quiz →”

Icon / illustration: quiz card with multiple-choice lines, one highlighted in “primary.” Style must match brand illustration style (outlined shapes, soft corners, minimal fill).

Card 2:

Step chip: “Step 2”

Headline: “See your custom routine instantly.”

Body:
“You’ll get a personalized, acne-safe morning + night routine right away — cleanser, treatment, moisturizer, SPF — mapped exactly to your skin type.”

Secondary line under body in smaller “subtle text”:
“No account required to view your first draft.”

Icon / illustration: simple silhouette face/profile or “routine layout” graphic. Use “primary” accents.
IMPORTANT: This is where we fix friction. You MUST include that the user can see their plan without creating an account.

Card 3:

Step chip: “Step 3”

Headline: “Lock it in and start clearing.”

Body:
“Create your free account to unlock the Ingredient Checker, get budget-friendly alternatives, and track weekly progress.”

Secondary line under body in smaller “subtle text”:
“Every product we recommend has passed our 400+ trigger scan.”

Icon / illustration: group of skincare bottles with check marks in “primary.”

Under the 3 cards:

Trust strip = two short reassurance points side by side (stack on mobile), each with a small outline icon.
Left reassurance:

Shield-check icon in “primary.”

Text: “Every recommended product is screened for pore-clogging ingredients.”
Right reassurance:

Clock / lightning-bolt icon in “secondary.”

Text: “Takes under 2 minutes.”

Below that trust strip, centered CTA button (pill, “primary” background, white text):
“Generate My Free Routine →”

SECTION 4. PERSONALIZATION FLOW
Goal: Prove that this is not random. Show the pipeline from inputs → logic → verified products → routine. This is “intelligence theater,” in a good way.

Section styling:

Full-width band on “muted background.”

Centered heading and subheading at top:
Heading (serif): “How AcneAgent Personalizes Your Routine”
Subheading (sans, “subtle text”):
“From your answers to your perfect product lineup — powered by ingredient science.”

Core component:

A horizontal flow (desktop) / vertical flow (mobile) of five connected “nodes.”

Each node:

Circular icon container with thin outline (stroke in “primary”).

Inside the circle: a simple outline icon.

Under the circle: short title (bold).

Under the title: one-line benefit (in “subtle text”).

Nodes, in order:

“Skin Quiz”
Benefit: “We learn your skin, lifestyle, and breakout pattern.”
Icon: clipboard/checklist.

“Analysis”
Benefit: “We match you to a dermatologist-informed treatment structure.”
Icon: bar graph / brain-circuit.

“Ingredient Scan”
Benefit: “We block products with known acne triggers.”
Icon: shield + molecule.

“Routine Builder”
Benefit: “We build an AM + PM plan step by step.”
Icon: bottles lineup.

“Clear Skin Plan”
Benefit: “You get exact products and how to use them.”
Icon: star/check or sparkle.

Animation requirements:

A thin “primary” line connects the nodes.

The line animates in a slow loop, left to right, like the system is “activating” each step.

When the animation reaches each node, that node briefly pulses:

Slight scale-up.

Soft glow ring in “primary.”

No harsh bounce, no flashing.

Below the flow, centered CTA:
“Take the Free Quiz →”

SECTION 5. WHY ACNEAGENT WORKS
Goal: This is the credibility hammer. This section needs to prove “why nothing else worked for you, and why this will.”

This section is split into three vertically stacked blocks, each visually distinct but clearly part of the same brand system. After these three blocks, include one last CTA.

BLOCK A — THE PROBLEM

Dark contrast card using a dark background tone with “inverted text,” rounded corners, generous padding.

Small label chip above the headline:

Chip background uses “secondary.”

Chip text is inverted (light).

Chip text: “THE PROBLEM”

Headline (serif, inverted text):
“Most ‘acne-safe’ products aren’t acne-safe.”

Body (inverted text, normal weight):
“Over 70% of skincare products marketed as ‘non-comedogenic’ still contain pore-clogging ingredients. AcneAgent screens every formula for 400+ known acne triggers — so you never waste money on products that quietly make breakouts worse.”

To the side on desktop / stacked below on mobile:
A “Rejected vs Approved” comparison component with two mini-cards:

Rejected card:

Thin border tinted toward “secondary.”

Title: “Drugstore ‘non-comedogenic’ cleanser”

Bullets with warning icons:
• “Contains common pore-clogging fillers”
• “Not barrier-safe for daily use”

Status badge: pill with “secondary” background and inverted text: “Rejected”

Approved card:

Thin border tinted toward “primary.”

Title: “AcneAgent-approved cleanser”

Bullets with check icons in “primary”:
• “0 pore-clogging ingredients”
• “Barrier-safe for daily use”

Status badge: pill with “primary” background and inverted text: “Approved”

Caption under the comparison in inverted subtle text:
“Every single product in your plan is vetted like this.”

BLOCK B — THE SCIENCE

Background returns to light / white.

Small label chip above headline:

Chip background uses “primary.”

Chip text: inverted light text.

Text: “THE SCIENCE”

Headline (serif, body text color):
“The ingredients your skin actually needs.”

Below headline: a 2x2 grid of “ingredient tiles,” each tile styled like a modern periodic element card.
Tile style rules:

White or near-white background.

Rounded corners.

“Soft clinical shadow.”

Thin border using “hairline border.”

Internal vertical stack layout.
Tile content (do all four):

Tile 1:

Symbol top-left in large bold type: “Bp”

Name: “Benzoyl Peroxide”

Tag pills (small rounded capsules):

“Antibacterial” (use “secondary” background if needed to differentiate)

“Clears pores” (use “primary” background if needed)

Short body:
“Kills acne-causing bacteria and calms active breakouts.”

Footer line in “subtle text”:
“Best for: inflamed acne, oily / resilient skin”

Tile 2:

Symbol: “Sa”

Name: “Salicylic Acid”

Tag pills:

“Exfoliant”

“Anti-inflammatory”

Body:
“Dissolves oil buildup inside the pore to stop new clogs from forming.”

Footer:
“Best for: blackheads, congestion, body acne”

Tile 3:

Symbol: “Ma”

Name: “Mandelic Acid”

Tag pills:

“Gentle AHA”

“Brightening”

Body:
“Resurfaces without burning or thinning sensitive skin.”

Footer:
“Best for: non-inflamed acne, uneven tone, deeper skin tones”

Tile 4:

Symbol: “Re”

Name: “Retinal”

Tag pills:

“Cell turnover”

“Barrier support”

Body:
“Speeds renewal and supports collagen while clearing stubborn congestion.”

Footer:
“Best for: adult acne, texture, fine lines”

These tiles MUST look like part of the same system: same radius, same spacing, same icon/tag style, same typographic hierarchy.

BLOCK C — PERSONALIZATION PROOF

Light card on “muted background.”

At the very top edge of the card, run a thin top bar in “primary” (like a colored stripe to brand the card).

Two-column on desktop / stacked on mobile.

Left column content:

Small label chip using “primary” background and inverted text:
“PERSONALIZED, NOT GENERIC”

Headline (serif, body text color):
“No two routines are the same.”

Body paragraph (body text color):
“AcneAgent builds your plan from 60 dermatologist-informed treatment structures. Each step in those structures can be filled with vetted, acne-safe product options. That produces over 112,000 possible routine combinations — and yours keeps adapting as your skin changes.”

Bullet list with “primary” check icons:
• “Always acne-safe”
• “Budget-first recommendations”
• “Smart swaps if you’re sensitive”

Right column content:

Stack three persona cards vertically. Each persona card:

Rounded corners.

Thin “hairline border.”

Very faint tinted background using a low-opacity wash of “primary” or “secondary” to differentiate them from plain white.

Content format:
Persona 1:
Headline: “Alex, 23”
Subtext: “Hormonal breakouts · Oily · Fitz 3”
Body small: “Routine uses benzoyl peroxide + oil-balancing cleanser.”
Persona 2:
Headline: “Sam, 32”
Subtext: “Non-inflamed acne · Sensitive · Fitz 5”
Body small: “Routine avoids harsh BHAs. Uses mandelic acid + barrier serum.”
Persona 3:
Headline: “Riley, 28”
Subtext: “Adult acne + early fine lines”
Body small: “Routine pairs retinal with barrier repair to prevent irritation.”

Below Block C:

Centered CTA button using “primary” background:
“Get My Free Routine →”

Microcopy under CTA in “subtle text”:
“Takes under 2 minutes. No credit card.”

SECTION 6. FOOTER
Goal: Calm close. Make it feel safe, credible, and legit.

Layout:

Light background (can be white or “muted background”).

Subtle top divider line in “hairline border.”

Left side: AcneAgent logo lockup again (molecule + wordmark).

Right side: simple inline links (“Privacy”, “Terms”, “Contact”).

Below or alongside: trust text in “subtle text,” small size:
“AcneAgent provides evidence-based acne guidance and acne-safe product recommendations. This is not a substitute for medical care.”

SEO in footer:

Include phrases: “personalized acne routine,” “acne-safe skincare recommendations,” “non-comedogenic products screened for pore-clogging ingredients.”

FINAL BEHAVIOR REQUIREMENTS

Every major section ends with a CTA.

Headline hierarchy must be logical (one main page headline in hero, then section headings as you move down).

All CTAs and micro-CTAs match the same visual family: pill shape, “primary” emphasis, arrow “→”.

All reassurance copy must feel like “you’re safe here / this will work / you get control immediately.”

All imagery is vector, outline-based, brand-consistent. No photos, no glossy fake bottles.

Animation is present but calm: hero molecules glow subtly, personalization flow line animates slowly, cards lift slightly on hover.

Absolutely no mention of code internals, file structure, variables, etc. Just implement the page visually and interactively with the above content, tokens, and behaviors.
