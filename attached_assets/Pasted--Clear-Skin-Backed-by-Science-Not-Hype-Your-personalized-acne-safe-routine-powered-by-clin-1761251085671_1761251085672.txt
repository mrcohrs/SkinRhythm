## Why Ingredients Matter

### 90% of “Acne Products” Contain Acne-Causing Ingredients

Even some luxury skincare and dermatologist-endorsed brands use **highly comedogenic ingredients** like *laureth-4* and *isopropyl myristate*.  
Nearly **9 in 10 benzoyl peroxide products** on the market contain *laureth-4*, which can block pores and undo results.  

AcneAgent only recommends **benzoyl peroxide formulas free of laureth-4** — and applies that same ingredient logic to every cleanser, serum, and moisturizer we suggest.
